This test is kind of non-perfect and a little confusing

* Parser hooks are processed multiple times giving duplicates
* Because of how backlink propagation for the EXEC taints work,
the second time around, $arg will be marked as YES_EXEC because
its later executed so we need to make sure anything that assigns
to that knows that. But because of duplicate processing, that means
second time around the error message will be YES_EXEC for $arg
instead of just YES_TAINT.
